# Technical Coding Interview Solutions

This project contains Java solutions for a set of technical coding interview problems, including test cases and a comprehensive test suite.

## Problems Included

1. **Sudoku Validator With Custom Zones**  
   Validates a 9x9 Sudoku board including custom zones for unique digits 1-9.

2. **Alien Dictionary**  
   Determines the character order of an alien language given a sorted list of words.

3. **Knights and Portals**  
   Finds the shortest path in a grid with one allowed teleport between empty cells.

4. **Bitwise Matching Pattern**  
   Finds the next larger integer with the same number of binary 1s as a given integer.

5. **Matrix Islands with Diagonals**  
   Counts the number of islands in a matrix considering diagonal connections.

6. **Bonus Challenge: Mini Interpreter**  
   A simple interpreter for let variable declarations and if conditions.

## How to Run

Compile all Java files:

```bash
javac TechnicalCodingInterviewSolutions/*.java
```

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
java TechnicalCodingInterviewSolutions.TestAllProblems
```

Each problem file also contains a `main` method with sample test cases that can be run individually.

## Approach Summary

- Each problem is solved with clean, modular Java code.
- Test cases cover typical inputs and some edge cases.
- The mini interpreter supports basic parsing and evaluation of let statements and if conditions.
- BFS, DFS, topological sorting, and bit manipulation techniques are used as appropriate.

## Notes

- Ensure Java 8 or higher is installed.
- The project is organized in the `TechnicalCodingInterviewSolutions` directory.
